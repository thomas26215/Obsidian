# $1^{st}$ part
I'm a sophomore student, undergraduate at the University Institute of Technology 2 (IUT2) in Grenoble. We have a lot of lectures, which serves us to understand the theory about what we do, but also tutorials to put into practice what we learned in lectures.
We have a lot of major courses, such as programmation (where we study various programmation languages) or networking, but we also have many minor courses that are equally important, such as economics,  communication or English.
To finish this paragraph, I'll speak about my chillhood : I studied in a middle school in Montelimar, called Marguerite Duras ; Next, I studient in the high school called LPO Les Catalins, in the same city, which focuses on scientific studies. I also obtained my A-level with honour.
