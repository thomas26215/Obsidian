# AI Wildfire Detection: A Promising Approach for the Amazon

**Abstract** : In 2023, 98 639 fire have been rescued in Amazonie and these fires have increased considerably over the last two years (2022 and 2023). Traditional fire detection methods have certain limitations in terms of speed of detection so a new study explores the use of artificial intelligence to improve fire detection speed. Professor Cíntia Eleutério of the Universidade Federal do Amazonas explains that "early detection of and response to forest fires is crucial to preserving the delicate ecological balance of these vital eco-systems" .This method could be used in conjunction with other existing artificial intelligences to improve early fire detection and, in particular, to address the current problem of forest fires and help fight forest fires around the world. To operate, this AI uses artificial neural networks that mimic the functioning of the human brain. The technology will also use advanced satellite imagery with deep learning. A convolutional neural network is also used to classify forest areas affected by fires. Finally, this AI has been trained on 200 fire images and 200 non-fire images to ensure a balanced learning approach. These images are provided from the Landsat 8 and 9 satellites The results are surprisingly good : given the small number of images given to the ia to detect fires, it has an accuracy of 93%  during the training phase from *International Journal of Remote Sensing*. The system could be integrated as a complement to existing early warning systems, enhancing detection and response capabilities. This approach could also be adapted to control deforestation, offering a versatile tool for forest management. The researchers still recommend training the ia with more images to increase its accuracy, testing in other regions to see if this technology can be used globally.
