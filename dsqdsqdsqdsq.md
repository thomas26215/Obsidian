As a second-year student at IUT2 in Grenoble, I find that my Belbin profile accurately reflects my background and personality. My high score as a Specialist (19) is explained by my early passion for programming, which I developed from the age of 12 with Scratch, then Python and Java.
This specialization has strengthened over the years, particularly through my self-taught learning and constant commitment to developing my programming skills.

My role as an Implementer (9) is manifested in my ability to put theoretical knowledge into practice, as demonstrated during the last SAE of the 2nd semester where I was able to effectively guide my team in completing coding tasks.

My introverted nature and preference for independent work probably explain my lower score as a Shaper. However, I am aware that developing my leadership skills is essential for my future career.

In summary, this combination of technical specialization and practical application allows me to thrive in a dynamic environment while continuously seeking to improve myself.
